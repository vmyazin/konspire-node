          <h2>Vasily Myazin, The Founder</h2>
          <p>Vasily Myazin, the founder of Konspire Design, started working with graphic design and web development in Russia back in 1996. Inspired by the European and American designers and developers, he quickly got a grasp on web technologies that led him to forming his own agency.</p>
          <p>Vasily's background is in print. Raised in the family of journalists and writers, he was exposed to print houses, typesetting, and desktop publishing systems since the early age. In the mid '90s, when the web started growing, Vasily quickly became passionate about all things online.</p>
          <p>These days he specializes in user interface design and user experience as a whole. Vasily enjoys brain-storming, conceptualizing, wireframing, prototyping, and adding polish to the final product. He's got the experience in producing web applications, most of them for usage by internal teams of enterprise companies (Sony is one of them).</p>
